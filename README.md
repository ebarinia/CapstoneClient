# Wiggle Waggy Walks

Welcome to our capstone project for CodeClan software development course: Wiggle Waggy Walks!

ðŸš¨ This Full stack web-application was built with Java/Spring Boot/PostgreSQL on the back-end, consisting on a REST API that handles client requests and connects to a PostgreSQL database to store data. In order for this application to work, it is imperative that you run the Spring boot server on a local machine for now. You can find the repo here: https://github.com/ebarinia/CapstoneServer.

### What is Wiggle Waggy Walks?

The concept behind the Wiggle Waggy Walks app is to create a platform that connects dog owners for a safe walk within Glasgow. Making it convenient for pet owners to ensure their dogs get to socialise with other dogs, getting the exercise they need. Our goal is to create a reliable and user-friendly platform that bridges the gap between dog owners in Glasgow, whilst ensuring the well-being and happiness of dog and owners.

On WWW, a user is able to create an account (or log in if already registered) and interact with other members - by sending an invitation for a walk, participate to a group walk event and even create one if they can't find a suitable one. They can even use the instant-messaging function within the application in order to chat in with other members in real time!


### The Technical Stuff

Like mentioned above, our app runs on a Spring Boot back-end server connected to a PostgreSQL database in order to store our data. 

For the front-end, we have built our application with React and SassyCSS. Additionally, we are also using Firebase real-time database and storage in order to store our images and new account details. 

One of the standout features we've implemented is the live-chat functionality, seamlessly integrated using Snapshots within Firebase. This facilitates real-time communication, enabling our users to engage effortlessly.

This tech stack fusion enables us to deliver a seamless, secure, and feature-rich application, ensuring optimal performance and user satisfaction at every turn.


## How to get started?

### 1. Clone the repository on your local machine

```
git clone git@github.com:ebarinia/CapstoneClient.git
```

Do this for both for the Client and the server. Run the server with the IDE of your choice.

### 2. CD into the newly installed folder

Then in your terminal:

```
npm install
```

This will install all the dependencies required to run the client. 

### 3. Starting the app

Once this is done, simply run the app in development mode

```
npm start
```

then head to localhost:3000 on your browser.
